## About

A chess engine using the Negamax algorithm and other optimization techniques able to consistently beat the 2200 rated bot on chess.com (Noam).
The GUI includes undoing moves, flipping and resetting the board, under promotions, and custom board positions and evaluation times.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

## Algorithms and Optimization Techniques Used

- Negamax algorithm
- Alpha-beta pruning
- Iterative deepening 
- Piece-square tables 
- MVV-LVA heuristic
- Principal variation search
- Quiescence search 
- Zobrist hashing 
- Late move reduction 
- Mate distance pruning 
- Null move pruning (Null Move Heuristic, NMH)

## Possible Improvements

- Switching programming languages
- Using a more detailed evaluation method (ex. use of opening tables)
- Transposition Tables
- Replacing the [Simplified Evaluation Function](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function) with [PeSTO's Evaluation Function](https://www.chessprogramming.org/PeSTO%27s_Evaluation_Function)
